# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-rays using Deep Learning

A deep learning project to classify chest X-ray images for pneumonia detection, built with TensorFlow and Keras. This repository documents the process of building, training, and evaluating several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models.

## üî≠ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a reliable model capable of distinguishing between NORMAL and PNEUMONIA chest X-ray images. This serves as an exploration into the application of computer vision and deep learning in medical diagnostics.

We experimented with three different approaches:
1.  A simple CNN built from scratch.
2.  The same CNN with heavy regularization (Dropout) to combat overfitting.
3.  A powerful model using **Transfer Learning** with the pre-trained **VGG16** network.

## üíæ Dataset

The dataset used is the "Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)" dataset available on Kaggle. It contains 5,863 images categorized into two classes: PNEUMONIA and NORMAL.

- **Training Set:** 5,216 images
- **Test Set:** 624 images
- **Validation Set:** 16 images (Note: A small validation set was used in the original dataset structure).

Data augmentation techniques (shear, zoom, horizontal flip) were applied to the training set to improve model generalization.

## üß† Models and Experiments

### Model 1: Simple CNN
- **Architecture:** A sequential model with two convolutional blocks followed by a dense layer.
- **Observation:** Achieved high initial accuracy but showed significant signs of **overfitting**.

### Model 2: CNN with Heavy Dropout
- **Architecture:** Same as Model 1, but with multiple `Dropout(0.5)` layers.
- **Observation:** The model became too constrained (**underfitting**), leading to unstable validation performance and lower overall accuracy.

### Model 3: Transfer Learning with VGG16 (üèÜ Best Model)
- **Architecture:** Used the pre-trained VGG16 model as a feature extractor. The base layers were frozen, and a new custom classifier was added on top.
- **Observation:** This model provided the best balance between accuracy and stability, with minimal overfitting. It is the recommended model.

## üìä Results

Here is a summary of the final test accuracy for each model:

| Model      | Description               | Test Accuracy | Overfitting |
| :---------:| :------------------------:| :-----------: | :---------: |
| Model 1    | Simple CNN                | ~92.8%        | High        |
| Model 2    | CNN + Dropout             | ~88.0%        | Unstable    |
| **Model 3**|**VGG16 Transfer Learning**|  **~91.8%**   |**Low & Stable**|

The learning curves clearly show that the VGG16 model is the most reliable.
